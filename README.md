# UTN-Metodologia-UltrasonicSensor
The proyect is about a prototype of a ultrasonic sensor for a house, a door or any object that you want to protect from a distance between 0cm and 30cm
it will tweet about that and it will sent you an email with the information captured.
In the web you will see all the info that the sensor captured all the way.

## Begin üöÄ
_These instructions would allow you to make a copy of the proyect working on your Board and arduino UNO for porpouse of development._
### Pre-requisites üìã
* [Arduino UNO] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Board).
* Ultrasonic Sensor Model: HC-SR04.
* 1 Led 5v.
* [Ethernet Shield] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShieldV1)
* Protoboard.
* 8 wires.        
```
[Arduino Genuino IDE] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
```
```
[Apache Server] (https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)
```
```
[MySQL workbench] (https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench)
```
```
We personally recommend to use [Xampp] (https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html) for the Apache Web Server and Database Mysql
```
### Instalation üîß
